# Deployment Configuration Fixes

## Applied Fixes for Permission Issues

### 1. Environment Variables Added
- `REPLIT_DISABLE_PACKAGE_LAYER_CACHING=1` - Disables package layer caching
- `REPLIT_PRESERVE_DEVDEPS=1` - Keeps development dependencies for build
- `NODE_ENV=production` - Sets production environment

### 2. Build Process Improvements
- Created `build-deploy.sh` script with proper error handling
- Added prebuild cleanup to remove old dist directories
- Optimized esbuild configuration with minification

### 3. File System Permissions
- Cleaned node_modules and reinstalled to resolve corrupted dependencies
- Added proper exclusion paths in deployment configuration
- Ensured dist directory is cleaned before each build

### 4. Usage Instructions

To deploy with these fixes:

```bash
# Use the deployment build script
./build-deploy.sh

# Or manually set environment variables
export REPLIT_DISABLE_PACKAGE_LAYER_CACHING=1
export REPLIT_PRESERVE_DEVDEPS=1
export NODE_ENV=production
npm run build
```

### 5. Verification
- Verify build artifacts are created in dist/
- Check that no permission errors occur during build
- Ensure all dependencies are properly resolved
